# Sherlock üïµüèΩ
Sherlock is the main program for fetching prices from various sources to the panprices database.

## How to run
### Dev Envoirment
1. Start the Cloud SQL Proxy by executing `~/Documents/rand_dev/cloud_sql_proxy -instances=panprices:europe-west1:panprices-psql=tcp:5432`. You might get prompted to sign in to Google Cloud. If so make sure that you log in to the panprices project. The proxy will then enable connection to the database locally via port 5432.
2. Then run the application with the starter script `bash run_dev.bash` that sets envoirment variables with the proper database connection info.
### Deployment
1. Then simply execute `gcloud app deploy app.yml`
2. Optionaly show the logs via `gcloud app logs tail -s sherlock`
